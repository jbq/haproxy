haproxy (1.3.14.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Configuration has moved to /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.  This allows to add the
  configurable /etc/haproxy/errors directory.
  The haproxy binary was also moved to /usr/sbin rather than /usr/bin, update
  your init script or reinstall the one provided with the package.
